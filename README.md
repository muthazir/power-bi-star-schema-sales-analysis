# Store Sales Performance & Profitability Analysis (Power BI)



## Problem Statement

This Power BI report enables stakeholders to analyze overall sales performance, profitability, discount effectiveness, and product-level performance using an optimized Star Schema data model.

The objective of this analysis is to:

1) Identify Top/Bottom 5 products by Sales, Profit, and Quantity Sold.  
2) Analyze sales trends over time (Daily, Monthly, Quarterly, Annually).  
3) Show relationship between Sales & Profit.  
4) Compare Sales/Profit/Quantity between two user-selected periods.  
5) Analyze average discount offered in each discount category.  
6) Calculate total number of orders.  
7) Display detailed order-level metrics (Sales, Profit, Discount, Net Sales) with dynamic filtering.  
8) Analyze sales performance across different cities.

The report is designed to support business decision-making by identifying revenue drivers, margin trends, geographic performance, and discount impact.

## Data Model Architecture

A **Star Schema** model was implemented to ensure optimized performance and clean filter propagation.

The model consists of:

- Central Fact Table
- Dimension Tables (Product, Customer, Promotion, etc.)
- Two separate Date Tables for advanced time intelligence
- Dedicated Measures Table for KPI calculations

### Date Tables Created

```
Date Table 1 = CALENDARAUTO()

Date Table 2 = CALENDARAUTO()
```

Two date tables were used to enable dynamic period comparison using inactive relationships and `USERELATIONSHIP()`.

This allows:

- Standard time filtering using Date Table 1
- Comparison period logic using Date Table 2
- Accurate time-based calculations without filter conflicts

A separate Measures Table was created to centralize all DAX calculations for better organization and scalability.

## Steps Followed

- Step 1 : Loaded Excel dataset (multiple tables) into Power BI Desktop.
- Step 2 : Opened Power Query Editor and enabled:
  - Column Distribution
  - Column Quality
  - Column Profile
- Step 3 : Selected “Column profiling based on entire dataset”.
- Step 4 : Performed data validation:
  - Checked for null values
  - Corrected data types
  - Ensured numeric consistency for Sales, Profit, Discount, and Units Sold
- Step 5 : Built a Star Schema model with one-to-many relationships.
- Step 6 : Created two Date Tables using `CALENDARAUTO()`.
- Step 7 : Implemented inactive relationship and used `USERELATIONSHIP()` for comparison logic.
- Step 8 : Created a dedicated Measures Table.
- Step 9 : Built report visuals across 5 pages covering KPI overview, product analysis, trend analysis, comparison analysis, and order-level drilldown.
- Step 10 : Published the report to Power BI Service.

## DAX Measures Created

### Quantity Sold

```
Quantity Sold =
CALCULATE(
    SUM('Fact Table'[Units Sold]),
    ALL('Date Table 1'),
    USERELATIONSHIP('Date Table 2'[Date],'Fact Table'[Date (dd/mm/yyyy)])
)
```

### Net Sales

```
Sum of Net Sales =
CALCULATE(
    SUM('Fact Table'[Net Sales]),
    ALL('Date Table 1'),
    USERELATIONSHIP('Date Table 2'[Date],'Fact Table'[Date (dd/mm/yyyy)])
)
```

### Profit

```
Sum Of Profit =
CALCULATE(
    SUM('Fact Table'[Profit]),
    ALL('Date Table 1'),
    USERELATIONSHIP('Date Table 2'[Date],'Fact Table'[Date (dd/mm/yyyy)])
)
```

### Total Orders

```
Total Orders = FORMAT(COUNTROWS('Fact Table'),"0")
```

These measures leverage:

- CALCULATE() for context transition
- ALL() to remove default date filtering
- USERELATIONSHIP() to activate alternate date logic
- Star Schema filter propagation for accurate aggregation
